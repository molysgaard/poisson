Poisson Solver

Required libraries for desktop version:
OpenMPI
CBLAS



Required software for plotting and analysis:
Octave or Matlab

Ubuntu/Debian packages for this:
sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev libgsl0-dev octave

Compilation:
make

To run the sequential implementation:

# runs the sequential implementation. Unless you have a machine with one core this will run on more than one core.
./sequential 4000

To run the distributed implementation:

# runs the MPI implementation with n=4000, mpiprocs=4 in a 2x2 grid, each mpiproc have 3 openmp threads.
mpirun -n 4 ./summa 2 2000 3

To view the solutions first start octave from the summa folder.

octave

Then inside octave run:

plotPoisson(4000)

and

plotPoissonSeq(4000)

to view the paralell and sequential solutions. Take note that the sequential and paralell problem may have different initial conditions and thus look different.
